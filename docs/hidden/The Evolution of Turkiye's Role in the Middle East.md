# Turkey is the eastern of the west and the western of the east

Turkey's foreign policy is complicated. it's not fixed.

Turkey is located at the heart of the middle east. between asia and europe.
# Ottoman empire legacy
- can be good can be bad
- When the empire collapsed, nationalism rose.

0 problems with neighboring states (lol)

Turkey have never had a problem with Indonesia.
Turkey have always supported palestinian causes

in 2009 there was a famous video. world economic fourm and prime minister of turkey said you are the killers and murderers.

# Question

- Regarding Turkey's goal to become the regional power. How would you address Turkey's societal problems regarding opression againts minorities. for example institutional opression against non-Muslim and non-Sunni minorities. Or general racism towards Kurds, Armenians, Arabs, Assyrians, Jews, and more specifically the tension between the country of Greece and Turkey since both have a rivalry with a history of events that have been used to justify their nationalism. (1923 Population exchange between Greece and turkey, the 1955 Istanbul pogrom, Cypriot intercommunal violence)
	- Answer : back then the kurdish lanugage was banned. Now it's not. Why? because of the current goverment. Turkey was very much commited to confront this political issue. Back them turkish was very nationalist. if you were not turk you'd be dead. for 100 years in turkey no president nor prime minister have opened a church, but now on the 100th anniversary we opened a church. the akhtamat church.
