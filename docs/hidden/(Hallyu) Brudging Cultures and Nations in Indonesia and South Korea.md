I think one thing this seminar hasn't mentioned regarding the one-sided relationship of the 2 countries is the stark economic difference between South Korea and Indonesia, Indonesia is a third world country while South Korea is a First-world. I'm sure we can't ignore that Korea has Samsung which is one of the richest and strongest companies in the world. A Samsung Chaebol practically has more power than a politician. My question is do you think these other strong industries in Korea like the tech Industry have a crucial role in aiding the goverment to fund and spread Korea's cultural influence?, if so. How can Indonesia compete with such strong economic difference and replicate what korea did in order to strengthen their economic power to help fund and spread Indonesian culture. 

Answer : 
	- Thankfully for now, Chaebol has no say in the Hallyu Industry in Korea, they're busy with smartphones and such
	- If they do get involved it will be bad, because it kills competition having a monopoly
	- **Collaboration** between the 2 countries is Necessary to help Indonesia build and spread their culture, whether it be student exchanges, goverment programs, Indonesian members in Kpop groups, etc2
	- the closet entertainment company to Chaebol is "Tous les jours related" (Look into this)
