- ##### Pergeseran politik. Pergerseran ke mana dulu?
	- Bergeser dari kawasan transatlantik (Amerika Eropa) ke Asia timur/Asia pasifik/Indo-pasifik
	- Abad ke 20 adalah abad eropa, Abad ke-21 adalaha abad asia pasifik
	- Northeast and Southeast Asia
	- Indo-Pasifik? Indian ocean vs pacific ocean tidak sebanfing, India factor

- Abad ke-20 merupakan abad trans-atlantik
- Pergeseran Geopolitik menjadikan ASia timur/Asia pasifik/Indo-pacific menjadi kawasan abad ke-21, utamanya dari perspektif ekonomi, walaupun increasingly political & security
- The region of East Asia is now the center of the world, Not a periphery

### Kenapa bergeser dari eropa ke asia?

- Kebangkitan Tiongkok akibat keberhasilan 40 tahun 'Reform & Openness' Yg dimulai deng Xiaoping (1979). Juga kemajuan ekonomi **Jepang**, Korea, dan "Asian Econ Tigers" Lainnya sejak 1970-an

History repeats itself. This is what happened before WW1 when german took over britian. German took over all the Europian Controlled land. More importantly the german economic and military power changed the balance of power and the aliansi system in Europe that has existed simce 1648. It has been reliant on Balance of power and Allied forces (Aliansi).

The trigger to WW1 isn't really just frans ferdinand getting assasinated. The question is with the rise of China in economic and military power. Will there be a WWIII?

There is a possibility, the difference is from WWI. Is the new emergence of weapons. Nuclear weapons, Anti-nuclear Missiles, and the likes.... 15k nuclear warheads exist in this world with the strenght of 10 Hiroshima bombs. in the race to attain Nuclear warheads is Mutually Assured Destruction (MAN). Noone is safe from these weapons. It could end civilization as we know it... For all we know it could happen on Accident... a glitch in the control panel perhaps, some troll hacks the goverment? dunno.

The difference of this compared to The Soviet Union back then was that the soviet Union was strong militarly but it was weak Economically.... china is both strong in those aspects.

- **Asean as a group is now the 5th largest economy in the world. Relatively peaceful**

## US [[China |China ]]rivalry
- Ketika Tension Meningkat, U.S & China would put pressure to others to side with either of them
- Not easy to resist
It's not just one aspect. in 2017. trump melancarkan trade war. 608 miliar dollar. Alesan amerika menderita defisit mereka melancarkan perang dagang. Harusnya amerika tidak memberikan sanksi yang sangat bilateral, 250%. BUT because america knows its wrongdoings. they kept silent. 

We're not stupid. The exploration to mars and plans to come back and revisit the moon is something that can definetly be militarized. We're not just gonna pickup rocks and bring em home.

## Respons amerika serikat

Kehadiran Superpower baru > Bipolar > Multipolar > Unipolar > Multipolar Politics
- AS tetap MRPK FOrmidable Power. Kekuatan Militer terbesar tetapi Economy menurun (Utang USD 33 Trillion dollars; defisit tahunan USD 2,2 trillion), Produktifitas menurun
- Politically Divided Internally, No strategic Thinking
- China determined to be the world (Super) Power. A century of Humiliation

America Admits that Taiwan is a part of the [[People's Republic Of China|People's Republic Of China]] 

## US China & ASEAN/Indonesia

- ASEAN could resist pressure to take side if it is united
- Problem : ASEAN is not United. Some are inclined to side with either China or the US. (Phnom Penh debacle of 2012 on SCS)> Make ASEAN Strong & Cohesive
- Continue to engage both, befriend, seek opportunity

# Indonesia/ASEAN Econ Engagement

- U.S Invested in ASEAN more than to China, Japan, S Korea and India Combined
- ASEAN-US Trade $135B
- China-ASEAN $145B (2000), $975B 
- Japan's Economy 2nd largest (2000), Was 8x ASEAN, today. 1.5x ASEAN
